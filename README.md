# Stronghold: Definitive Edition Zoom unlock mod

Zooming was locked on my 5120x1440 monitor, so I made a quick mod to unlock it. You can download and install it if you're interested

The mod requires Melon Loader (modding framework for Unity games)

## Installation

- Download and run [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation)
    - Click the SELECT button
    - Select and Open "Stronghold 1 Definitive Edition.exe" in your Game's Installation Folder (You can find it by Right-clicking the game in your library > Properties > Local Files > Browse...)
    - Click the INSTALL button
- [Download the mod .dll file](https://github.com/Oryss/StrongholdDEMod/releases/download/v1.0/StrongholdDeMod.dll)
- Put the dll in the Mods folder, inside the game's Installation Folder

Running the game should now open a console window, you can ignore it.

## Settings

You can change the "sensibility" of zooming by changing the file in {GameInstallationFolder}\UserData\MelonPreferences.cfg

Setting the "Zoom sensibility" to 0.4 makes zooming way faster for example
